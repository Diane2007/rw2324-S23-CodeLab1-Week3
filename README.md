# Cleaning up the elephant game

The previous scripts were long and messy. This time I:

1. rebuilt the first two scenes with properties to access values
2. fixed the problem that a heart will spawn whenever player touches the animals. Now it only appears whenever the relationship point increases.

Laundry list:
1. finish up the player changing color thingy
2. add the swim scenes and make new friends scenes.
